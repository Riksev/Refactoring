# Refactoring
This project was based on code from book "Refactoring: IMproving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke, don Roberts".
Firstly, Java code was rewrited into JavaScript. Secondly, test were added. Thirdly, some refactor methods from book were made.
After that I added own changes into code.
# Files
Main files are videoStore_old and videoStore_new. The old one contains rewritten code (from Java to JS) from the beggining of the book.
New version has finished code with refactoring. Also project has package.json in order to let you know, which modules were used and to
use it with NPM from Node.js. Also, there is videoStore.test included. Enjoy observing project!
